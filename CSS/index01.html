    <p style="background-color: lightsalmon;">A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars usually consider a castle to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a mansion, palace and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively 
        for pleasance and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified.</p>


    <p style="color: lightgreen;">Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of
         which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for
         both defensive purposes and to pacify
          the country's inhabitants . Towards the end of the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military
           significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications.</p>
           
           

    <p>Although castle has not become a generic term for a manor house (like ch√¢teau in French and Schloss in German),
         many manor houses contain castle in their name while having few if any of the architectural characteristics, usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term castle was a masculine expression of their power.
         In scholarship the castle, as defined above, is generally accepted as a coherent concept, originating in Europe and later spreading to
          parts of the Middle East.</p>
